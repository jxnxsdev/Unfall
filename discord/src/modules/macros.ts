Make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date.\n3. Your game may be corrupted.

Modded mapping comes in two flavors, Mapping Extensions (ME) and Noodle Extensions (NE). \n\n- For basic maps you can use ME with setup info on [the wiki](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/extended-mapping.html#mapping-extensions). \n- For some more advanced stuff you should use NE and can create using [ChroMapper](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/#chromapper) or [ScuffedWalls](https://github.com/thelightdesigner/ScuffedWalls#readme) (deprecated).\n- To create modcharts or similar refer to [this guide](https://github.com/StormPacer/How-to-Noodle) by StormPacer (slightly outdated, but okay start), the [NE documentation](https://github.com/Aeroluna/Heck/wiki) and [NE animation docs](https://github.com/Aeroluna/Heck/wiki/Animation). For advanced modcharts, and especially for making modded v3 maps, [ReMapper](https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper) is recommended to streamline the process. **Note:** these types of maps require you to make your own tooling/scripts to assist the creation process at this time.\n!color FFAA00",

Use SideQuest's file browser to get here.\n\nDrag any image that's in equirectangular projection and a 2:1 ratio. If you need to find these, you can look at the [#backgrounds](\u003chttps://discord.com/channels/691791384922816594/805307266914844682\u003e) channel on the [Qosmetics Community](\u003chttps://discord.gg/JNuFC7XMTk\u003e), or you can do a quick search for `equirectangular images 2:1` with your favorite search engine.\n!color b57edc",
